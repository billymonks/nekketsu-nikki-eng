# Translation Style Guide

Guidelines for consistent tone and style across the translation.

## General Principles

1. **Preserve personality** - Each character has a distinct voice; maintain it
2. **Natural English** - Don't translate literally; make it sound natural
3. **Context matters** - Consider who's speaking and the situation
4. **Brevity** - Dialog boxes have limited space; be concise

## Tone

This is a high school fighting game with comedic and dramatic elements. The tone should be:
- Energetic and youthful
- Dramatic during serious moments
- Playful during comedic scenes
- Appropriate to each character's personality

## Honorifics

**Decision**: [Decide whether to keep or localize honorifics]

Options:
- Keep Japanese honorifics (-san, -kun, -chan, -sensei)
- Localize to English equivalents
- Mix (keep -sensei, drop others)

Current approach: TBD

## Name Order

**Decision**: [Decide name order]

Options:
- Japanese order (Family Given): Ichimonji Batsu
- Western order (Given Family): Batsu Ichimonji

Current approach: TBD

## Punctuation

- Use `...` for trailing off or pauses
- Use `!` for excitement/shouting (don't overuse)
- Use `?!` for shocked questions

## Common Expressions

| Japanese | Translation | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| よろしく | Nice to meet you / Let's do this | Context-dependent |
| がんばれ | Good luck / Do your best / You got this | |
| すごい | Awesome / Amazing / Incredible | |
| やった | Yes! / I did it! / Alright! | |
| まさか | No way / It can't be | |

## Things to Avoid
